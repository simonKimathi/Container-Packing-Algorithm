Getting highest occupancy rate of capacity of a container is very important for the companies,
which deals in shipping or has shipping as a part of their main activities. They have to fit 3D boxes in
container with optimum or nearest to optimum placement in order to ship more products with a minimum
cost. The problem of fitting the boxes which is different from or the same to each other into a big
container in optimum level, is called 3-dimensional packing problem. In this problem, the main objective
is to minimize used container volume or wasted container space. This provides the reduction of costs in
shipments with the use minimum number of containers.
Design an efficient algorithmic solution to solve this industry problem.
